Hello! I am Shiro.
I'm mostly interested in books, writing, KPOP, and drawing. My career goal is to hopefully be a mix of a psychologist, writer, and journalist. I want to be a psychologist because being able to understand and help people gives me a sense of fufillment. This course might be able to help me learn to communicate with others better.
