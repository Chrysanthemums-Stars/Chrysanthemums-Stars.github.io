# About Me
Hello! I am Shiro.
I'm mostly interested in books, writing, KPOP, and drawing. My career goal is to hopefully be a mix of a psychologist, writer, and journalist. I want to be a psychologist because being able to understand and help people gives me a sense of fufillment. This course might be able to help me learn to communicate with others better.

My top career choice is a combination of being a psychologist and a writer. Because I love psychology and I love books. Writers don’t make much money but it is a passion of mine to write stories that people will love and be interested in. There’s an old Japanese philosophy I find very important and that I want to live by. It’s called Ikigai, and it translates to “a reason for being” or “the thing that you live for”. It means that we aren’t here for a specific purpose and that our existence doesn’t have to be for utility and being useful to the state. If anything it’s a process of finding what you like and revolving your ‘life’s purpose’ around it. Project management can help me actually complete books I think about writing. And communication can help me with being a psychologist and helping my patients with their issues.

This is my role model, his name is Seonghwa and he's an idol with a genderless like sense of fashion. He is one of the people who inspire me to just be myself. He debuted as a model and even walked for Isabel Marant as her first male model during Paris Fashion Week. And that was his first time doing modeling and runway stuff. If I ever got to design clothes like that I'd ask him to be a model for me.
